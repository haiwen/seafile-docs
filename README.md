# Introduction

Seafile is an open source cloud storage system with file encryption and group sharing. 

Collections of files are called libraries, and each library can be synced separately. A library can be encrypted with a user chosen password. This password is not stored on the server, so even the server admin cannot view a file's contents.

Seafile allows users to create groups with file syncing, wiki, and discussion to enable easy collaboration around documents within a team.

## Translation (Work In Progress)

Even if you are not familiar with [gettext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gettext) system, you can start translating this manual following 3 simple steps.

As an example to translate files from **overview/** folder to *Spanish*, these 3 steps are:

1. copy **po/overview.pot** to  **po/overview.es.po**.
1. Translate messages in **po/overview.es.po** to spanish language.
1. Send us your **po/overview.es.po** for integration. You can also make a pull request, if you modified an already existing po file.


If you are familiar with POT and PO files, you can use the one in **po/** folder.
