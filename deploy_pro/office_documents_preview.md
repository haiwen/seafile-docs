Seafile Professional server supports previewing office/pdf documents online, to use it you need to follow the steps described on this page.

### Install Libreoffice/UNO ###

Libreoffice 4.1+ and Python-uno library are needed to enable office files online preview.

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```
sudo apt-get install libreoffice libreoffice-script-provider-python
```
> For older version of Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libreoffice python-uno`

On Centos/RHEL:
```
sudo yum install libreoffice libreoffice-headless libreoffice-pyuno
```

For other Linux distro: [Installation of LibreOffice on Linux](http://www.libreoffice.org/get-help/installation/linux/)

Also, you may need to install fonts for your language, especially for Asians, otherwise the  office/pdf document may not display correctly.

For example, Chinese users may wish to install the WenQuanYi series of truetype fonts:

```
# For ubuntu/debian
sudo apt-get install ttf-wqy-microhei ttf-wqy-zenhei xfonts-wqy
```

- Document preview doesn't work on my Ubuntu/Debian server, what can I do?

Current office online preview works with libreoffice 4.0-4.2. If the version of libreoffice installed by `apt-get` is too old or too new, you can solve this by:

- Remove the installed libreoffice:
```
sudo apt-get remove libreoffice* python-uno python3-uno
```
- Download libreoffice packages from [libreoffice official site](http://sourceforge.net/projects/libreoffice.mirror/files/LibreOffice%204.1.6/)

- Install the downloaded pacakges:
```
tar xf LibreOffice_4.1.6_Linux_x86-64_deb.tar.gz
cd LibreOffice_4.1.6.2_Linux_x86-64_deb
cd DEBS
sudo dpkg -i *.deb
```

- Restart your seafile server and try again. It should work now.
```
./seafile.sh restart
```
