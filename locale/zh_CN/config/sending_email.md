# 发送邮件提醒

## Types of email sending in Seafile

There are currently five types of Emails sent in Seafile:

- User reset his/her password
- System admin add new member
- System admin reset user password
- User send file/folder share link and upload link
- [pro] Reminder of unread notifications (It is sent by a background task which is pro edition only)

The first four types of Email are sent immediately. The last type is sent by a background task running periodically.

## Options of email sending

Please add the following lines to seahub_settings.py to enable Email sending.

<pre>
EMAIL_USE_TLS = False
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.example.com'        # smpt 服务器
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'username@example.com'    # 用户名和域名
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'password'    # 密码
EMAIL_PORT = 25
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER
SERVER_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER
</pre>

If you are using Gmail as email server, use following lines:

<pre>
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'username@gmail.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'password'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER
SERVER_EMAIL = EMAIL_HOST_USER
</pre>

**注意1**: 如果邮件功能不能正常使用，请在<code>logs/seahub.log</code>日志文件中查看问题原因. 更多信息请见 [Email notification list].

**注意2**: 如果你想在非用户验证情况下使用邮件服务，请将 <code>EMAIL_HOST_USER</code> 和 <code>EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD</code> 置为 **blank** (<code>''</code>). (但是注意一点，这种情况下，邮件将不会记录发件人<code>From:</code>信息.)

**Note3**: About using SSL connection (using port 465)

Port 587 is for using TLS connection to the Email server. Port 465 is for using SSL connection.  Starting from Django 1.8, it support both. But we are still using Django 1.5 in version 5.0, which only support  TLS connection. If your email server only support SSL connection, you can find a work around here: https://github.com/bancek/django-smtp-ssl.

## Change the `sender` and `reply to` of email

You can change the sender and reply to field of email by add the following settings to seahub_settings.py. This only affects email sending for file share link.

<pre>
# Replace default from email with user's email or not, defaults to ``False``
REPLACE_FROM_EMAIL = True

# Set reply-to header to user's email or not, defaults to ``False``. For details,
# please refer to http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/
ADD_REPLY_TO_HEADER = True
</pre>

## Config background email sending task (Pro Edition Only)

The background task will run periodically to check whether an user have new unread notifications. If there are any, it will send a reminder email to that user. The background email sending task is controlled by `seafevents.conf`.

```
[SEAHUB EMAIL]

## must be "true" to enable user email notifications when there are new unread notifications
enabled = true

## interval of sending seahub email. Can be s(seconds), m(minutes), h(hours), d(days)
interval = 30m
```

## Customize Email messages

The simplest way to customize the Email message is setting the `SITE_NAME` variable in seahub_settings.py. If it is not enough for your case, you can customize the Email templates.

**Note:** Subject line may vary between different releases, this is based on Release 5.0.0. Restart Seahub so that your changes take effect.
